But we are in 2025, and I'm giving you a talk where I don't talk about AI and I'm not credible so what I propose you as time remains we're going to add AI because in addition it's called Jarvis.

I'm going to use something that's called LangChain4J.
Do you know LangChain?
Ok LangChain4J is the same thing but in Java so for those who know LangChain bah it's the same thing but in Java.

Ok so basically this is a framework that will allow me to consume API that expose mainly LLMs (like Open AI for example) but without bothering me to know how it works behind.
